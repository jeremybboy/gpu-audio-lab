# Raspberry Pi Audio – Real-Time BPM Estimator

Standalone real-time BPM detection system using a Raspberry Pi and USB audio interface.
The system captures live audio, estimates tempo using autocorrelation, and displays BPM on an OLED display.

Designed to operate as a **bootable hardware appliance** controllable remotely via SSH.

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 5
- USB Audio Interface (e.g. Steinberg UR22 / Behringer)
- SH1106 OLED display (I2C)
- USB power supply
- 
This project is a standalone Raspberry Pi 5 device that captures live audio from a USB interface and displays a stable real-time BPM on an SH1106 OLED using an autocorrelation-based estimator.
Audio is captured at 44.1 kHz via ALSA, mixed to mono, converted to an energy envelope, buffered (~8s), processed with FFT autocorrelation, peak-detected, folded into 90–180 BPM, smoothed with hysteresis, and rendered to the OLED.
Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5, Behringer UCA202 (USB Audio CODEC), SH1106 I2C OLED (0x3C); Software: Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm Lite 64-bit, Python venv, numpy, sounddevice, luma.oled, pillow.
The engine prioritizes stability over instant lock, achieves accurate tempo tracking with low CPU usage on Pi 5, and is designed for live pedal-style operation.
Planned improvements include faster initial lock via dual-window estimation, silence hold behavior, beat phase indication, and systemd appliance-mode autostart.

The script captures stereo audio from the USB Audio CODEC at 44.1 kHz, mixes it to mono in a callback, and continuously stores samples in an 8-second rolling buffer.

Every 0.5 seconds, if the signal RMS is above a noise threshold, it computes a smoothed energy envelope (rectify + 25 ms low-pass) and runs an FFT-based autocorrelation to estimate the dominant tempo lag.

It converts the detected lag to BPM, folds half/double-time into the 90–180 BPM range, and applies hysteresis smoothing so the displayed BPM is stable but still responsive.

During the first few seconds after startup, it uses a shorter analysis window for faster initial lock, then switches to a longer window for improved stability.

The locked BPM, RMS level, and device info are rendered to the SH1106 OLED in real time, while debug information is printed to the terminal.


BPM Algorithm 
The algorithm first converts the audio to mono, computes an RMS check for signal presence, and generates an energy envelope by rectifying the signal and applying a short low-pass filter (~25 ms).

It applies a Hann window and computes an FFT-based autocorrelation of the envelope to efficiently measure periodicity over a multi-second buffer.

It searches for the strongest autocorrelation peak within a lag range corresponding to 90–180 BPM, then refines the peak position using parabolic interpolation for sub-sample accuracy.

The detected period is converted to BPM and folded into the target range by doubling or halving to correct half-time or double-time errors.

Finally, it applies hysteresis smoothing so small changes follow quickly while larger jumps are damped, producing a stable displayed tempo.

Convert to mono
Rectify + low-pass filter → energy envelope

## 🧠 Architecture (old)

1. Capture stereo input via `sounddevice`
2. Convert to mono
3. Detect beats using `aubio.tempo()`
4. Store IOIs (Inter-Onset Intervals)
5. Compute:

```
BPM = 60 / mean(IOI)
```

6. Print BPM every 2 seconds

# TODO – Next Iteration (v2.1)

## 1. Faster Initial Lock
- Implement dual-window system (2s fast estimator + 8s stable estimator)
- Add confidence metric (peak strength + short-term stability)
- Display provisional BPM (~) until confirmed

## 2. Silence Hold Logic
- Add RMS gate threshold
- Freeze last BPM when below threshold
- Add small “HOLD” indicator on OLED

## 3. Beat Phase Indicator
- Implement simple phase accumulator (0–1 per beat)
- Sync phase using envelope peaks
- Render minimal visual progress indicator on OLED
